<p><h3><b>Consider Aptitude and Not Marks:</h3></p></b>
<p>Marks secured in examinations are turning out to be killers of today. These two and three digit numbers are responsible for taking the lives of students. We have seen in the last couple of weeks, the drastic action taken by some of them who could not clear their examinations - they ended up taking their lives.     
Thousands of students fail to get admission into their desired stream - arts, commerce or  science due to limited number of seats in the colleges. Often, students do not know which of these fields they are objectively suitable for.
Inherently, every student has a blend of strong aptitudes, interests and personality, which makes them suitable for certain careers. Students should therefore consider their Aptitudes, Interests and Personality, and not just their marks before they decide on which career and stream they should choose. They must remember that: <br>
1.    Marks are not the only indicator of one's abilities.<br>
2.    Marks are just based on memory tests.<br>
3.    Marks only indicate academic proficiency.<br>
4.    Seats are limited and there are many students who do not get admission on the basis of their marks.<br><br>
<p><h3><b>Why You Should Consider Aptitudes:</p></h3></b>
<p>
Aptitude is an inherent psychological property of an individual to learn some trade. Every student has a set of these capabilities which will help him become suitable for certain careers. Similarly every student has some naturally strong interest areas and predominant personality characteristics.
Students, and more importantly, parents must understand this and make their children feel at ease, even if they have scored less marks. Today, there are numerous options after SSC which they can take up, without attending regular college.
It is always better that students get their aptitudes, interests and personality assessed by a vocational counsellor. This will help him make the right decisions about his education and help him move in the right direction regarding the career he is likely to take up in future.</p><br><br>
