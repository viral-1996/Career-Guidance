<b>Making the right career choice</b>
<br><br>
Choosing the right career might be one of the most important decisions that one makes. Being satisfied with what you do on a daily basis is the key to success and happiness.
<br>
Fortunately for you, there is a process by which you can make the right career decisions.
 <br><br>
<h3>Step 1- Know Yourself</h3>
<br>
There is no universal right career. What you have to find is what is the right career for YOU.<br>
The first step in finding the right career for you is knowing yourself. While there are many ways to introspect and analyze yourself the most scientific way is to take a career assessment test.<br>
The right career assessment test will measure your interests, aptitudes and personality traits and then integrates the results to provide you with the career best recommendations.<br>
<br>
<h3>Step 2- Know your options</h3>
<br>
Once you have completed the test you will get a better understanding of what the right career choices are for you. The next step is to better understand these career options.
<br>
Learn the details about what it means to have a career in a particular field. What does a particular career option mean, what are the educational requirements, which colleges offer these courses, what are the job options once you get the degree?
<br><br>
<h4>How do you find out all this information? </h4>

Read articles on the Internet, browse through websites, ask industry experts and career counselors / career guide and gather as much information as you can.
<br>
<h3>Step 3- Make an Informed Decision</h3>

After step 1 and 2 are complete you are ready to make an informed decision. Take the information you gathered about yourself in step 1 and couple it with what you learned in step 2.
Introspect, speak to your family and friends and then make the right career choice and go on to have a successful career.
