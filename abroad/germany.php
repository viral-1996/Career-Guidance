In a social gathering or business meeting, shake hands with everyone when you arrive and leave. Punctuality and correct dressing is important.
Remember never to keep your hands in your pockets while talking to a person. Importantly, do not be offended if your behavior in a public place is corrected by a stranger. In Germany, policing one another is considered a social duty.
