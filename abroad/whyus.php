<b>Why Study in USA</b>
<p>
As the number one destination for international students, the U.S. offers most attractive opportunities and choices for furthering your education.
<br><br>
The United States has an outstanding higher education system. Every year The Times Education Supplement ranks the top universities worldwide and, according to this year's evaluation, 12 out of the first 20 are from the US.
</p>
<b>Qualitative Education</b><p>

Distinguished programs at over 3,600 colleges, universities, and institutes provide both undergraduate and graduate students with choices in more than 900 fields of study. A close relationship between research and education has brought a number of U.S. institutions to the forefront of research and technological development. At such universities students usually learn under the direction of world-renowned faculty who range from Nobel Laureates to Pulitzer Prize winners. The success of U.S. higher education relies on the use of cutting-edge technology and top learning facilities, excellent teaching, coupled with personalized study programs and individual attention.</p>

<b>Freedom of Choice</b>
<p>
Diversity of educational opportunities ensures that students will find an institution that matches their academic and social interests. Depending on the academic experience they are looking for, students have numerous types of institutions to consider, be it a public or private university, a liberal arts college, a technical school, a women's or men's only college, a religiously-affiliated institution, and so forth. In addition, a variety of settings (i.e. small or large cities, suburban or rural areas, etc.) coupled with myriad of climates can further match a student's choice of academic experience.
</p>
<b>Academic and extracurricular offer</b><p>

Even though U.S education places high emphasis on academic work, in the American perspective a successful academic experience includes much more than tests, lectures, and study sessions. Beyond the classroom walls, countless extra-curricular activities give students a chance to develop leadership skills and community spirit. U.S. universities promote outside-class learning through varied social, cultural, and sports activities.<br><br>
