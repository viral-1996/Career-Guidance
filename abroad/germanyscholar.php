<b>Scholarship's</b><br>
<p>
Germany offers scholarship of two kinds– monetary and non-monetary, and both can be even clubbed together. The financial scholarships, usually fixed amounts, are paid out over a defined funding period on a monthly basis.These kinds of scholarships are often full scholarships, and usually cover the entire living expenses of the applicant.On the other hand, recipients of partial scholarships, have to secure additional financial support in order to cover their living expenses.<br><br>
Apart from financial support, many German institutions also offer non-monetary scholarships.The recipients of such scholarships are invited to lectures, workshops, and technical conferences, providing them with opportunities to network with other scholarship holders. As a general rule, these non-monetary scholarships try to create lasting relationships between the scholarship holder and the institution, even after the scholarship period.
