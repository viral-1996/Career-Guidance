<b>Why Study in United Kingdom</b>
<p>
<br>
The UK has grown to become one of the top destinations to study around the world. With traditions of excellence dating back hundreds of years, high class institutions at every corner and much more flexibility than many other countries, the United Kingdom has much to offer international students that other English-speaking countries cannot offer.<br>

But what makes the United Kingdom stand out? Why should you come to the UK as a destination to further your international education?<br><br>

<b>Growing Destination<br></b>
International students have always been an important presence in the UK, and the numbers have been growing steadily. With over 330,000 international students during the 2005/2006 school year, the UK is the second most popular destination for international students, behind the US. The UK has worked hard to capitalize on the growing demand for English-language instruction and the post-9/11 visa hurdles in the US. The top ten countries sending students to the UK are:
<br>
      1.China 50,755<br>
     2.India 19,205<br>
     3.Greece 17,675<br>
     4.Republic of Ireland 16,790<br>
     5.USA 14,755<br>
     6.Germany 13,265<br>
     7.France 12,455<br>
     8.Malaysia 11,450<br>
     9.Nigeria 9,605<br>
     10.Hong Kong 9,445<br><br>

<b>Worldwide Recognition:</b><br>
The degrees and qualifications from UK higher education institutions are known around the world as high quality and world class. The standard of excellence is set by some of the older universities with recognizable names, like Oxford and Cambridge, but the tradition carries through to many of the universities and colleges throughout the UK. When looking for work in the future, this can be a great selling point in your favour!<br><br>

<b>Education Costs are Lower:</b><br>
The cost of education for an international student in the UK can be lower compared to the USA and other countries. Some courses in the USA can be $25,000 plus a year in tuition alone. Tution for the majority of UK higher education institutions is in the region of £6,000 to £7,000 a year - considerably less!
