<b>Student Life</b><br><br>
Ireland is a beautiful country, and no matter where you choose to go to study on the island, there will be endless opportunities for socializing and enjoying life outside of study hours. Life on Ireland’s campuses is full and varied. Most students have a very pleasurable time at university in Ireland, and get just as much satisfaction from their social and cultural activities as from their studies.<br><br>

Culture Shock:<br> Beginning college or university can be a shock to the system for many people. Irish campuses can be big places with thousands of students swarming around, so it is easy to become lost, both geographically and metaphorically. Luckily, college authorities hold induction and welcome weeks where international students are shown around, while being told all about the facilities and services there for them to use. Freshers’ week usually follows soon after, when more experienced students induct their new counterparts into the various social activities and practices that are all part of the third-level experience.<br><br>

Comforting Factors:<br> Irish campuses are now very multicultural, with students from many backgrounds and of various nationalities rubbing shoulders between classes. All Irish campuses now have comfortable restaurant and socialising facilities. Most students spend a good deal of time in the library, whether finding books, taking notes or endlessly photocopying, so most Irish libraries are modern and comfortable.<br><br>

Many colleges have dedicated student centres, which are home to a host of useful facilities and services. These include International Student Offices, medical centres, accommodation and disability services, bookshops, Internet access and sometimes a crèche and/or chaplaincy.
