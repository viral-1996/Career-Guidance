<b>Student Life in the United States</b>

<p> 
USA is the world’s favorite destination for international students. Around, 600,000 students have chosen to broaden their education and life experience in the United States.
 
Living in America will open up a completely different environment for you. American values and culture are imbibed from a variety of cultures around the world. This diversity is very valuable to you as a student. There are places in USA that may closely resemble your country. May be a regional pocket where you find others from your country. Once you decide on the academics then you can choose an accommodation that has the above comforting factor in it.<br><br>
 
Learning more about yourself is perhaps the most important part of your decision to travel to the U.S. Once you know what you want to achieve, then you can identify the right place to study and live and grow in the States.<br><br>
 
You may face new challenges. At times feel confused, unsure and uncomfortable. Different values and the new culture may shock you or seem strange. You may miss your family, so be sure to keep in touch with friend and relatives if any, in USA. Also find support group in your study circle or near your place of living.<br><br>
 
People that you meet through your school’s international student office may also be a likely source of support. </p>
