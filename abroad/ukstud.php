<b>Student Life in the United Kingdom</b>

<p> 
UK is a melting pot of people from different cultures. In London, there are foreign communities from most parts of the world.<br><br>
 
British people are usually open-minded to foreigners, and revere the freedom to have different opinions and beliefs. People usually feel free to express their own opinions and wear what they want.<br><br>
 
People may not agree with you all of the time. British people have a strong sense of humor, but you may find it difficult to understand when someone is joking.<br><br>
 
In general, a British citizen waits for an introduction before they speak to a stranger in a group. It is a culturally rich country. People are quite modest. Life is peaceful. Be prepared for the chilly weather.</p>
